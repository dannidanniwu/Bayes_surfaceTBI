Creating a Bayesian GAM from scratch in Stan without borrowing any design matrices or other components from the frequentist GAM fit requires more effort and decision-making. Here, I'll outline a simple approach using Gaussian processes, which can capture non-linear trends similar to splines in a GAM.

To create a Bayesian version of the model:
\[ y \sim \text{Gaussian}(\alpha + A \beta_A + f(k) + f(k, site), \sigma^2) \]
Where:
- \( f(k) \) is a non-linear function of \( k \) (which we'll model using a Gaussian process).
- \( f(k, site) \) is an interaction term between \( k \) and `site` (which we can also model with a Gaussian process).

The model's complexity and the Gaussian process can make Stan code quite extensive. Below is a simplified and abstracted version for illustrative purposes:

```stan
data {
  int<lower=1> N;          // Number of data points
  vector[N] y;             // Response variable
  vector[N] A;             // Linear predictor variable
  vector[N] k;             // Non-linear predictor variable
  int<lower=1> S;          // Number of sites
  int site[N];             // Site indices for each observation
  real<lower=0> rho_k;     // Length-scale for Gaussian process for k
  real<lower=0> rho_ks;    // Length-scale for Gaussian process for k-site interaction
  real<lower=0> alpha_k;   // Output variance for Gaussian process for k
  real<lower=0> alpha_ks;  // Output variance for Gaussian process for k-site interaction
}

parameters {
  real alpha;              // Intercept
  real beta_A;             // Coefficient for A
  vector[N] f_k;           // Gaussian process for k
  matrix[N, S] f_ks;       // Gaussian process for k-site interaction
  real<lower=0> sigma;     // Noise variance
}

model {
  matrix[N, N] cov_k = cov_exp_quad(k, alpha_k, rho_k);
  matrix[N, N] cov_ks[S];
  
  for (s in 1:S) {
    cov_ks[s] = cov_exp_quad(k[site == s], alpha_ks, rho_ks);
  }
  
  // Gaussian process priors
  f_k ~ multi_normal(rep_vector(0, N), cov_k);
  for (s in 1:S) {
    f_ks[, s] ~ multi_normal(rep_vector(0, N), cov_ks[s]);
  }

  // Linear regression part
  y ~ normal(alpha + A * beta_A + f_k + row_sum(f_ks), sigma);
}

```

This is a high-level conceptual model. The Gaussian process allows us to model the non-linear effects of \( k \) and the interaction between \( k \) and `site`. In practice, Gaussian processes are computationally intensive, and the above model would likely require some optimization and efficiency considerations, such as using sparse approximations.

Also, note that setting appropriate priors for the hyperparameters (`rho_k`, `rho_ks`, `alpha_k`, `alpha_ks`) is critical. In this illustrative version, they're passed as data, but you might want to estimate them as parameters depending on your actual data and problem context.

If you want the combined effect of the intercept (\( \alpha \)), the linear term (\( A\beta_A \)), and the non-linear term \( f(k) \) to have an average of zero across all data points, you can enforce this through a constraint.

Here's how you can modify the Stan model to include this constraint:

```stan
model {
  matrix[N, N] cov_k = cov_exp_quad(k, alpha_k, rho_k);
  matrix[N, N] cov_ks[S];
  
  for (s in 1:S) {
    cov_ks[s] = cov_exp_quad(k[site == s], alpha_ks, rho_ks);
  }
  
  // Gaussian process priors
  f_k ~ multi_normal(rep_vector(0, N), cov_k);
  for (s in 1:S) {
    f_ks[, s] ~ multi_normal(rep_vector(0, N), cov_ks[s]);
  }

  // Constraint to ensure mean of alpha + A*beta_A + f(k) is zero
  target += -0.0001 * pow(sum(alpha + A * beta_A + f_k), 2);

  // Linear regression part
  y ~ normal(alpha + A * beta_A + f_k + row_sum(f_ks), sigma);
}
```

Here, the constraint `target += -0.0001 * pow(sum(alpha + A * beta_A + f_k), 2);` ensures that the sum (and hence the average) of the combined effect \( \alpha + A\beta_A + f(k) \) across all data points is approximately zero. 

Again, the penalty term `0.0001` might need adjusting based on your specific application. Adjusting it will change how strictly this constraint is enforced. This is a soft constraint, so while it encourages the mean to be zero, it doesn't strictly enforce it. If you need the constraint to be more strict, you can increase the penalty term.
